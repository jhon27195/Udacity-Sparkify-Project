# Udacity-Sparkify-Project

## Introduction

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program. In this project we will explore a dataset from Sparkify, an online music platform similar to Spotify. The goal of this project is to better understand user behavior on the Sparkify platform and predict churn using data analytics and predictive modeling techniques.
